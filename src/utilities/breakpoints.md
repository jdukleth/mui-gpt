# Breakpoints Utility

This utility provides a set of default breakpoints for use within components. They are based on standard device sizes and MUI's recommended breakpoints.

## Breakpoints

- `xs`: Extra small devices.
- `sm`: Small devices.
- `md`: Medium devices.
- `lg`: Large devices.
- `xl`: Extra large devices.

## Usage

Import and use the breakpoints in your components to provide responsive behaviors.

```javascript
import { breakpoints } from './utilities/breakpoints';
